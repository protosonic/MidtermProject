## Lessons learned
- We realized that developing a website from scratch takes a lot of work and time. Starting with just modeling the entity relationship diagram especially with many-to-many mappings and composite keys, this alone took roughly 20 hours.
- Once the diagram was established, creating entities for that was not too difficult but still time consuming.
- Jay: Styling the web was not easy as I expected. As we added more components and forms things started to get messy and break apart. Through lots of trial and error, I got a better understanding of the layout consistency. Also being a DBA in this project I realized how important this role was  when it comes to designing the tables and avoid inconsistencies.
- Kirstin: Personally, my biggest lessons learned here was the integration of git/github and branching. I think I developed a better understanding of how to collaborate with a team and avoid merge conflicts by using separate branches.
- Nick: Building out the MVC controllers helped reinforce my understanding of the relationships and purpose of the MVC work flow. Getting hand on and applying what we have learned has given me confidence and understanding.
